# Home Owl ðŸ¦‰

Home Owl is a household chore tracker. Create (recurring) chores, mark them as completed and collect points!

Home Owl makes it fun and easy to keep track of who does how much work around the house. To create a fair workload distribution and a happy and relaxed vibe around chores.

<!-- Notes to self
* Stopped here: https://youtu.be/YkOSUVzOAA4?t=9619

* Find a hosted database service (maybe supabase?) with automated backups
  * https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/database/supabase
  * https://authjs.dev/reference/adapter/supabase

* Consider Flutter for all frontends..?
