# Home Owl ðŸ¦‰ - Backend
Fastify typescript backend for Home Owl. Connects to a SQL database configured in `.env` and exposes a CRUD API for the home owl frontend.

It uses [Clerk](https://clerk.com) for authentication and user management and [Upstash](https://upstash.com) for rate limiting.

## How to run

### Setup
* Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
* Create `.env` based on `.env.sample`, create accounts for [Clerk](https://clerk.com) and [Upstash](https://upstash.com) and fill their API keys
* `npm i --legacy-peer-deps` to install dependencies  (legacy peer deps required because of `zod-prisma`)

### Prisma
The backend uses Prisma to manage the database. The following commands let you generate code from `./prisma/schema.prisma` and sync the schema to the database. Make sure your database is available and the correct `DATABASE_URL` is configured in `.env` first.

* `npx prisma generate`
* `npx prisma db push` to sync database

### Running the backend service
* Run database in docker from Home Owl root with `docker compose up -d`
* `npm start` to run
